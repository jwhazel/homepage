    "description": "In late February when the realization of a looming pandemic hit, I started building tools for our newsroom to help track the spread. | I built one of the first API's that scraped and aggregated multiple sources of data into a consistent format useful for ingestion into other apps and analysis programs.| Maps existed, but the lack of normalization for per capita rates meant that they were just population density maps that didn't tell the full story. So I built an interactive one that normalized confirmed rates and deaths per county by total and by last 48 hours. This helped our team get a better handle on what hotspots were occuring and where. | Testing data was available, but fragmented and not easily compared so I built a chart that helped visualize how and if the curve was flattening relative to any state and its surrounding states.",

    "description": "The crazy wall was an idea conceived by our design studio to combine research from multiple reporters and help visualize the flow of a Mexican cartel's infiltration into areas across the US. The problem is that the image is so large and so detailed that it simply cannot be shared online in it's full size. I wrote the processing script that slices this massive gigapixel image into tiles so that you can zoom and pan just like a map. I then wrote an app that allowed reporters to collaborate and place annotations on top of it in the form of markers to make it easier for the pubic to have some context about what they're looking at.",

This spreadsheet was distributed among our newsroom for use on follow up and analysis in stories. I took the initiative to quickly build a public facing database to help enhance our coverage. The Courier Journal newsroom went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for coverage of this story.",
